# Store Sales Forecasting using Time Series Analysis
## Introduction
Welcome to the Store Sales Forecasting project!
In this intriguing project, we delve into the realm of time series analysis to predict store sales for Corporation Favorita, a major grocery retailer in Ecuador. The goal is to leverage historical sales data, along with supplementary information like promotions, oil prices, holidays, and store metadata, to construct a robust predictive model. By harnessing the power of data insights, we aim to provide accurate forecasts that empower businesses to enhance decision-making, optimize resources, and ultimately boost their bottom line. Join us on this journey as we explore, analyze, and model the intricate sales dynamics to unlock valuable insights and guide strategic choices.
